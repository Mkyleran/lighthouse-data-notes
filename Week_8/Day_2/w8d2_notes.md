Deep Learning II

## Lecture

### Topics

- Different DL Architectures
  - CNN
  - RNN
  - LSTM
- Evolution of DL Architectures
- Best practices when designing a network
- Image Recognition

## Core

- More complex Neural Networks are Deep Neural Networks
- Training Deep Neural Networks is called Deep Learning

Architectures

- Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP)
  - at least 3 layers
  - each node in a layer connects to every node in the next layer
- Convolutional Neural Networks
  - often used for images
  - accounts for spacial relation (i.e. a pixel has 8 neighbors)
  - pooling and falttening
  - the flattened CNN is passed to a final MLP
- Recurrent Neural Networks
  - memory
  - time series, historic trends to predict future
  - NLP, linguistic context to predict next word
