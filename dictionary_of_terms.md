# Statistics
**Homoscedasticity**:

>In statistics, a sequence of random variables is homoscedastic if all its random variables have the **same finite variance**. This is also known as **homogeneity of variance**. The complementary notion is called heteroscedasticity. The spellings homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity are also frequently used.
