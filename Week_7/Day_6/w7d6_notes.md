### Introduction to deep learning

Video: [A friendly introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR9h47Jtqyw)

- DL is an expression of ML
- In ML, define the error and minimize it
- Neural network is the basis of DL
- Goal of DL is splitting data
- continuous vs discrete function
  - discrete error functions need to be made continuous by adding continuous (probabilistic) penalties to each record
  - this is done using an activation function. Every point in the feature space is assigned a value between 0 and 1
