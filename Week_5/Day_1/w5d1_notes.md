- [How to Train a Final Machine Learning Model](https://machinelearningmastery.com/train-final-machine-learning-model/)
- [Cross-Validation in Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-in-machine-learning-72924a69872f)

#### Overfitting

[Overfitting in Machine Learning: What It Is and How to Prevent It](https://elitedatascience.com/overfitting-in-machine-learning)

#### Class Imbalance

[8 Tactics to Combat Imbalanced Classes in Your Machine Learning Dataset](https://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/)

- Undersampling, oversampling

#### Sampling Bias

[Understanding sampling bias](https://david-hamill.medium.com/understanding-sampling-bias-8c757e2ace8d)

### Model Evaluation

#### Regression Metrics

The most widely used evaluation metrics in regression models are:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)
- Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE)
- R² or Coefficient of Determination
- Adjusted R²

#### Classification Metrics

The most commonly used evaluation metrics in classification models are:

- Accuracy
- Precision/Recall
- F1-score
- ROC curve/AUC score
- Log-Loss
- Lift/Lift curve
